## Welcome to the 2nd MILC Workshop 
MILC 2019 is held in conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces ([IUI 2019](http://iui.acm.org/2019)) and will take place on March 20th, 2019 at the Marriott Marina Del Rey in Los Angeles, CA, USA. Stay tuned for further information, call for papers, and submission dates.

## Workshop Motivation
Today's music ecosystem is permeated by digital technology — from recording to production to distribution to consumption. Intelligent technologies and interfaces play a crucial role during all these steps. On the **music creation** side, tools and interfaces like new sensor-based musical instruments or software like digital audio workstations (DAWs) and sound and sample browsers support creativity. Generative systems can support novice and professional musicians by automatically synthesising new sounds or even new musical material. On the **music consumption** side, tools and interfaces such as recommender systems, automatic radio stations, or active listening applications allow users to navigate the virtually endless spaces of music repositories.

Both ends of the music market therefore heavily rely on and benefit from intelligent approaches that enable users to access sound and music in unprecedented manners. This ongoing trend draws from manifold areas such as interactive machine learning, music information retrieval (MIR) — in particular content-based retrieval systems, recommender systems, human computer interaction, and adaptive systems, to name but a few prominent examples. Following the successful [first edition held in Tokyo 2018](https://iui2018milc.github.io), the **2nd Workshop on Intelligent Music Interfaces for Listening and Creation (MILC 2019)** will bring together researchers from these communities and provide a forum for the latest trends in user-centric machine learning and interfaces for music consumption and creation.

## Exemplary Topics of Interest
- Music and audio search and browsing interfaces
- Adaptive music user interfaces
- Music learning interfaces
- Music recommender systems
- Gamification in music interfaces
- Novel visualization paradigms
- New technologies for human expression, creativity, and embodied interaction
- Machine learning for new digital musical instruments
- Gestural interfaces for music creation and listening
- Accessible music making technologies
- Intelligent systems for music composition
- User modeling for personalized music interfaces

## Submissions
All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. We solicit three types of submissions:
- **Full papers** (up to 6 pages)
- **Short papers** (up to 4 pages)
- **Demo papers** (up to 4 pages)

Submissions must follow the standard SigCHI format, using one of the following templates: [LaTeX](https://github.com/sigchi/Document-Formats/tree/master/LaTeX), [Microsoft Word](http://st.sigchi.org/sigchi-paper-template/SIGCHIPaperFormat.docx). Note that **references count towards the page limits**.

Please **anonymize your submission (double-blind reviewing policy)** and submit your paper via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=milc2019). Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Authors of accepted submissions will be required to attend and give a presentation at the workshop. The workshop proceedings are to be published in the joint proceedings of the ACM IUI 2019 Workshops.
